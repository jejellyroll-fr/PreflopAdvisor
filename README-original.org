* Preflop Advisor based on Monker

Small tool to read frequencies and EVs from PLO and PLO8 Monker preflop simulation for a given hand.
NL is generally also supported but is currently not working out of the box.

* Getting Started

- Copy project to location of your choice
- Export Monker Ranges of the trees you want to use
- open preflop_advisor/config.ini (use the IDLE Editor if Windows Editor shows no newlines)
  - Section [TreeSelector] edit NumTrees
  - Section [TreeInfos] add trees using full path
  - Section [TreeToolTips] add further tree infos you want to show when hoovering over it. 
    If you dont need it set ToolTips in [TreeSelector] to NO.
    Number of ToolTips has to match number of trees.
    My description currently contains: First line opening frequencies; 2nd line some flatt|3bet frequencies; 3rd line vs 3bet flatt|4bet frequencies
  - Currently only Potsize Raises or ALL_IN are supported. 
    If you have different sizes in your tree you have to edit [TreeReader] section. 
    See comments there
- you can install the tool in your python distribution using 
  python setup.py install
  or just start the tool by running standalone.py in the top folder using python3
- On high Resolution Monitors the Font can be little bit too small:
  - CardSelector Font is in: card_selector.py BUTTON_FONT at the top
  - TreeSelector Font is in: config.ini [TreeSelector] -> FontSize
  - PositionSelector Font is in: config.ini [PositoinSelector] -> FontSize
  - Output Font is int: output_objects.py -> RESULT_FONT
  - I know very bad style ... just change fontsize and / or font as you like...the gui overall is even more ugly on windows than on linux ^^

* Interface Description

** Top Left Cardselector
Select wanted hand. If you have 4 cards and select another card it asumes you want to enter new hand and starts over again.
If you click on a selected card it gets unselected. 
** Bottom Left Treeselector
Shows the list of Trees available. Depends on your config.ini settings. If configured it shows tooltip when hoovering over a button.
If you select different tree it updates output for currently selected hand.
** Top Middle Position Selector
X is the devault overview for all positions for open strategy and HU 3bet or vs 3bet strategy.
Selecting a Position shows more detailed infos about 4bet vs4bet and squeeze spots.
** Top Right Outputgrid
Top line shows Hand, Position and general Information about the currently selected Tree
*** General Overview (Posiiton = X)
First column shows available positions. 
Second column the first in action. For positions other then SB it asumes the there is only openraise possible. 
For Example UTG FI for this hand shows: 
- 1 Line Raise100 (meaning potopen...it shows the descrition for the sizing given in config.ini)
- 2 Line 0 (Shows the frequency suggested by monker; If the frequency is over 50% the item is has lighter background for better visibility)
- 3 Line -0.14 (EV estimate by monker in BIG BLINDS (changed that from default monker milli-sb because I am more used to it))
also in contrast to monker interface it shows relative EVs (when facing for example a 3-bet it shows ev compared to folding at this point and not overall ev from the start)
Other column shows infos vs positions -> if position in top line comes before our position it shows action us facing an openraise. Left item is 
call, right item is 3bet. Otherwise we open and face a 3bet from the other position (left item call 3bet; right item 4bet)
Small Blind has option to openlimp. If your tree only thas open or fold strategy you get an error message in the terminal output which can be 
ignored. It then just shows the raise item. SV vs BB entry shows action after we openraise. For action after we openlimp and BB raises see SB position view.
*** Position Overview
- First result line is equal to the corresponding result line from default view
- Squeeze: Gives the action for column position opens and player right next to him coldcalls and it folds to us where we can call/squeeze. 
So it is the "tightest" of the squeeze spots possible vs this opener. Again if there is no 2nd overcall in the tree it writes error message to terminal.
- 4bet: If column position is before is it asumes an open from the player before him, he 3bets and we have the option to cold4bet. Otherwise it 
shows standard we open and face a 3bet from the other position.
- vs 4bet: same idea. position before us means we face 4bet from opener after we 3bet him and otherwise we face cold4bet after we 3bet player right before us.
- vs squeeze: we open and player right next to us flatts and we then face the squeeze from the column position (classic sandwitch spot)
